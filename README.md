# Caesar Shift Cipher:
- This primitive type of cipher can be used to very simply encrypt a message with a number key between 1 and 26.
- It works by taking the message and shifting each letter to the right by the number of the key
- Example: Hello World!
    - Key: 1 -> "ifmmp xpsme!"
    - Key: 26 -> "hello world!"
    - Key: 52 -> "hello world!

# Vignère Cipher:
- A Vignère cipher is a slightly more complicated cipher with the main difference being that the key is a word.
- The best way to understand how the cipher works is through the table below:
| A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M | N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | X | Y | Z |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
