# Caesar Shift Cipher:
- This primitive type of cipher can be used to very simply encrypt a message with a number key between 1 and 26.
- It works by taking the message and shifting each letter to the right by the number of the key
- Example: Hello World!
    Key: 1 -> "ifmmp xpsme!"
    Key: 26 -> "hello world!"
    Key: 52 -> "hello world!
